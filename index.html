                        Most red giant models do not reproduce the position of the observed luminosity bump, a diagnostic of the maximum extension of the convective envelope during the first-dredge up. (see right hand figure based on <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859..156K/abstract" target="_blank"> Khan et al. 2014</a>) Global seismic parameters, the large frequency separation and frequency of maximum oscillation, show that overshoot below the convective envelope helps match red giant model luminosity bump positions to observed bump positions. The global seismic properties, however, cannot be used to probe envelope overshoot in a star-by-star manner. The long time series of Kepler and the TESS continuous viewing zones allow us to determine the individual mode frequencies of many red giants and these individual modes allow us to probe the internal structure of the stars. Red giant mixed modes (modes that are p-like at the surface and g-like in the core) contain important information about the interior structure of the star. We present the results of a theoretical study to investigate the seismic signature of convective overshoot in red giants. Our intention is to use these signatures to determine the amount of overshoot needed to model observed frequencies in red giants that have high quality seismic data.

        <h1>Motivation</h1>

        <h3>Why Red Giant Seismology</h3>
        <div class="features">
                <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
                    Red giants are very bright and can be seen from extremely far distances with high signal to noise. Spaced based photometry missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed tens of thousands of oscillating red-giants stars as the cadence of their observations is favorable for red giant oscillation mode detection. 


                    Individual mode parameters can be extracted from many target stars with high quality photometric data. We want to use these individual modes to determine the input physical parameters for stellar models, particularly convective overshoot, a phenomena that occurs when convective parcels of fluid overshoot convective boundaries due to their momentum. To study the effects of this process we employ asteroseismology, a powerful tool which can probe stellar interiors.

        <h3>Position of the Red Giant Branch Bump Changes With Envelope Overshoot</h3>
        <div class="features">
                <embed src="images/Overshoot_APO.pdf" #view=FitH width="660" height="600" style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" alt="" />
                    <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
                        After a main sequence star exhausts its supply of Hydrogen in the core, it is left with an inert Helium core surrounded by a Hydrogen burning shell which is in turn surrounded by a cool, convective envelope which swells greatly in size during the red giant phase. A star can spend millions to a billion years evolving up the red giant branch, decreasing in surface gravity as it expands and becomes more luminous. An interesting and relevant section of ascending red giant branch evolution is called the red giant branch luminosity bump and appears as a zig-zag shape apperent in a red giant's H-R diagram evolutionary track. This luminosity bump occurs when the deepening convection zone reaches down to the position of the hydrogen burning shell. 

                        The position of the red giant bump in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a> models of varying masses do not match up with the overdensity of red giants observed in catalogs such as the APOKASC catalogue. The above figure and right hand figure show temperature on the x axis and the frequency of maximum oscillation power (&nu;<sub>max</sub> ) on the y axis. &nu;<sub>max</sub> is proportional to surface gravity which in turn is proportional to luminosity. Studies such as <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859..156K/abstract" target="_blank"> Khan et al. 2014</a> have claimed overshooting could potentially explain the red giant branch bump discrepancy. 

                        Since the position of this red giant branch bump depends on the deepening convection zone and therefore depends on how convection is modeled, a thorough investigation into how modeling convection changes red giant properties is necessary.

        <h3>MESA for Modelling Convection</h3>

            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
            Stellar evolution codes like <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a> generally use a mixing length approximation to model convection. Mixing length theory is analogous to the concept of mean free path in thermodynamics where a fluid parcel will conserve its characteristics for a certain “mixing length” before being incorporated with the surrounding fluid. This means that within convection zones, the stellar model is fully mixed (no change in element abundances) but no mixing occurs outside of the convective zone boundaries. This is a rough approximation and focusing on the convective boundaries, there should be parcels of fluid overshooting the convective boundaries due to their own momentum. This would mean an effective change in the position of the convective boundaries and how much overshooting there is across boundaries is an important unknown input parameter in stellar modeling. Overshoot in MESA is treated as overmixing and the code includes two options, step overshoot and exponential overshoot. 
            </p>
           
            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"> These two overshoot modeling methods change the mixing efficiency versus interior mass profile of a stellar model in two slightly different ways as shown in the above schematic. Step overshoot extends the convectiv, high mixing zone past the convective boundary by a distance of a free parameter f<sub>overshoot</sub> times the pressure scale height at the boundary position. Exponential overshoot extends the high mixing convective zone in a slightly more complicated way where the mixing efficiency falls off exponentially from the convective mixing value once you move a characteristic distance parameterized also parameterized by f<sub>overshoot</sub> away from the convective boundary.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">To investigate the effect of different overshoot values, we made stellar models using the evolution code <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a> which solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. 
                
            NOTE: Core overshoot is also important in the main sequence evolution of a star but since the cores of red giants aren’t convective, core overshoot manifests as a fossil signature from the main sequence. In future work though, we will look into the signatures of core overshoot.

                The asteroseismic pulsations visible on the photospheres of stars by missions like Kepler are produced by standing waves traveling inside the star. Waves where the restoring force is pressure are called p modes and can only exist with frequencies above two characteristic frequencies called the lamb frequency and the brunt vaisala frequency. 
                On the other hand, waves where the restoring force is buoyancy are called gravity modes or g modes and exist with frequencies below the lamb and brunt vaisala frequencies. In regions of a star where the brunt vaisala frequency is imaginary, the stellar fluid is unstable to convection and we have a convection zone. The effective position of the convection zone is changed with the implementation of envelope overshoot. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
                Between the g and p mode cavities is a classical forbidden region where both g mode and p mode oscillations are damped exponentially. This forbidden region is wide in main sequence stars (see left hand figure above) but as a star evolves into a red giant, the p and g mode cavities close in towards each other and modes in each cavity can couple to each other giving rise to mixed modes (see right hand figure above.)

                Implementing step envelope overshoot changes the elemental abundance profile of the stellar model. The upper left animation shows the Hydrogen abundance (solid lines) and Helium abundance (dashed lines) evolution for red giant models of different overshoot values as they move up the red giant branch. Similarly, at given values of surface gravity, log(g), red giant models with different overshoot values (values of f) have slightly different Brunt–Väisälä frequency profiles since the profile bump signature of the first dredge up changes location based on different values of f (see upper right animation.)

                We used the stellar oscillation code <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3406T/abstract" target="_blank"> GYRE</a> to calculate the oscillation mode frequencies (and therefore periods) of each of the different overshoot models at each evolutionary log(g) value.
                
                Red giant mode frequencies are generally equally spaced in period so it is informative to plot the period difference between consecutive modes as a function of frequency.
                The upper left hand figure shows pairwise period difference versus mode frequency for log(g) = 3.0 red giant models with different values of step envelope overshoot. Similarly, the upper right hand figure shows the same for log(g) = 2.6 red giant models. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
                At log(g) = 3.0, none of the different overshoot red gian models have gone through the red giant branch luminosity bump and therefore the period spacing versus mode frequency plots match up between models of different overshoot. On the other hand, at log(g) = 2.6, the f = 0.6 overshoot model has gone through the red giant branch luminosity bump, resulting in a significant decrease in the median value of the period spacing. Clearly, at a given value of log(g), red giant models with different overshoot values have significantly different oscillation properties especially around the red giant branch luminosity bump.
