        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <div class="features">
            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
                Most red giant models do not reproduce the position of 
the observed luminosity bump, a diagnostic of the maximum extension of 
the convective envelope during the first-dredge up. (see figure 1 based 
on <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859..156K/abstract" target="_blank"> Khan et al. 2014</a>)
 Global seismic parameters, the large frequency separation and frequency
 of maximum oscillation, show that overshoot below the convective 
envelope helps match red giant model luminosity bump positions to 
observed bump positions. The global seismic properties, however, cannot 
be used to probe envelope overshoot in a star-by-star manner. The long 
time series of Kepler and the TESS continuous viewing zones (CVZ) allow 
us to determine the individual mode frequencies of many red giants and 
these individual modes allow us to probe the internal structure of the 
stars. Red giant mixed modes (modes that are p-like (i.e., acoustic 
modes) at the surface and g-like (i.e., gravity modes) in the core) 
contain important information about the interior structure of the star. 
We present the results of a theoretical study to investigate the seismic
 signature of convective overshoot in red giants. Our intention is to 
use these signatures to determine the amount of overshoot needed to 
model observed frequencies in red giants that have high quality seismic 
data.

        <h1>Motivation</h1>

        <h3>Why Red Giant Seismology</h3>
        <div class="features">
            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
                Red giants are intrinsically very bright and can be seen
 from extremely far distances with high signal to noise. Spaced based 
photometry missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed tens of 
thousands of oscillating red-giants stars as the cadence of their 
observations is favorable for red giant oscillation mode detection. 


                Individual mode parameters can be extracted from many 
target stars with high quality photometric data. We would like to use 
these individual modes to determine the input physical parameters for 
stellar models, particularly convective overshoot, a phenomena that 
occurs when convective parcels of fluid overshoot convective boundaries 
due to their momentum. To study the effects of overshoot we employ 
asteroseismology, a powerful tool which can probe stellar interiors.  
            </p>

        <h3>Position of the Red Giant Branch Bump Changes With Envelope Overshoot</h3>
        <div class="features">
            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
                After a main sequence star exhausts its supply of 
Hydrogen in the core, it is left with an inert Helium core surrounded by
 a Hydrogen burning shell which is in turn surrounded by a cool, 
convective envelope which swells greatly in size during the red giant 
phase. A star can spend millions to a billion years evolving up the red 
giant branch depending on its mass, decreasing in surface gravity as it 
expands and becomes more luminous. An interesting and relevant section 
of ascending red giant branch evolution is called the red giant branch 
luminosity bump and appears as a zig-zag shape apparent in a red giant's
 evolutionary track on the HR diagram. This luminosity bump occurs when 
the deepening convection zone reaches down to the position of the 
hydrogen burning shell. 

                The position of the red giant bump in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a> models of varying masses do not match up with the overdensity of red giants observed in catalogs such as the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..215...19P/abstract" target="_blank"> APOKASC</a> catalogue. Figures 1 and 2 show temperature on the $x$-axis and the frequency of maximum oscillation power ($\nu_\text{max}$ ) on the $y$-axis. $\nu_\text{max}$ is proportional to surface gravity which in turn is proportional to luminosity. Studies such as <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859..156K/abstract" target="_blank"> Khan et al. 2014</a>
 have claimed overshooting could potentially explain the red giant 
branch bump discrepancy. 

                Since the position of this red giant branch bump depends
 on the deepening convection zone and therefore depends on how 
convection is modeled, a thorough investigation into how modeling 
convection changes red giant properties is necessary.

 models for a 1.4 solar mass and metallicity red giant with increasing 
values of envelope overshoot. The higher step envelope overshoot pulls 
down the position of the red giant branch bump to be more in line with 
the observed overdensity in stars as observed by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..215...19P/abstract" target="_blank"> APOKASC</a>.

        <h3><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a> for Modelling Convection</h3>

                <img src="images/Overshoot_Mixing.png" style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" alt="">
                <figcaption style="margin-bottom:1cm;">Figure 3 (right,)
 shows a mixing efficiency versus radius diagram for a convective 
boundary incorporating step overshoot. The mixing efficiency in the 
convection zone, $D_\text{convective}$, is high and the mixing efficiency in the radiative zone, $D_\text{radiative}$,
 is low. Step overshoot extends the convective, high mixing zone past 
the convective envelope's boundary by a distance of a free parameter $f_\text{overshoot}$ times the pressure scale height at the boundary position. In step overshoot, the mixing efficiency in the overshoot region is $D_\text{overshoot} = D_\text{convective}$. 
                     
            </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
            Stellar evolution codes like <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a>
 generally use a mixing length approximation to model convection. Mixing
 length theory is analogous to the concept of mean free path in 
thermodynamics where a fluid parcel will conserve its characteristics 
for a certain “mixing length” before being incorporated with the 
surrounding fluid. This means that within convection zones, the stellar 
model is fully mixed (no change in element abundances) but no mixing 
occurs outside of the convective zone boundaries. This is a rough 
approximation and focusing on the convective boundaries, there should be
 parcels of fluid overshooting the convective boundaries due to their 
own momentum. This would mean an effective change in the position of the
 convective boundaries and how much overshooting there is across 
boundaries is an important unknown input parameter in stellar modeling. 
Overshoot in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a>  is treated as overmixing and the code includes two options, step overshoot and exponential overshoot. 
            </p>
           
            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"> These two overshoot modeling 
methods change the mixing efficiency versus interior mass profile of a 
stellar model in two slightly different ways and for this poster, we 
focus on the effects of step envelope overshoot. Step overshoot extends 
the convective, high mixing zone past the convective envelope's boundary
 by a distance of a free parameter $f_\text{overshoot}$ times the pressure scale height at the boundary position as shown in figure 3. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">To investigate the effect of different overshoot values, we made stellar models using the evolution code <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract" target="_blank"> MESA</a>
 which solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations 
simultaneously. 
                
            NOTE: Core overshoot is also important in the main sequence 
evolution of a star but since the cores of red giants aren’t convective,
 core overshoot manifests as a fossil signature from the main sequence. 
In future work though, we will look into the signatures of core 
overshoot.

            <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
                The asteroseismic pulsations visible on the photospheres
 of stars by missions like Kepler are produced by standing waves 
traveling inside the star. Waves where the restoring force is pressure 
are called p modes and can only exist with frequencies above two 
characteristic frequencies called the Lamb frequency and the 
Brunt–Väisälä frequency. 
                On the other hand, waves where the restoring force is 
buoyancy are called gravity modes or g modes and exist with frequencies 
below the Lamb and Brunt–Väisälä frequencies. In regions of a star where
 the Brunt–Väisälä frequency is imaginary, the stellar fluid is unstable
 to convection and we have a convection zone. The effective position of 
the convection zone is changed with the implementation of envelope 
overshoot. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
                Between the g and p mode cavities is a classical 
forbidden region where both g mode and p mode oscillations are damped 
exponentially. This forbidden region is wide in main sequence stars (see
 left hand figure above) but as a star evolves into a red giant, the p 
and g mode cavities close in towards each other and modes in each cavity
 can couple to each other giving rise to mixed modes (see right figure 
above.)

 shows two period spacing versus frequency plots for 1.4 solar mass 
models with solar metallicity and different amounts of step envelope 
overshoot. Red giant mode frequencies are generally equally spaced in 
period so it is informative to plot the period difference between 
consecutive modes as a function of frequency. The oscillation mode 
frequencies for our models were calculated with the stellar oscillation 
code <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3406T/abstract" target="_blank"> GYRE</a>.
 The upper left hand figure shows pairwise period difference versus mode
 frequency for $\log g = 3.0$ and the upper right hand figure shows the 
same for $\log g = 2.6$ red giant models.

                At $\log g = 3.0$, none of the different overshoot red 
giant models have gone through the red giant branch luminosity bump and 
therefore the period spacing versus mode frequency plots match up 
between models of different overshoot. On the other hand, at $\log g = 
2.6$, the $f = 0.6$ overshoot model has gone through the red giant branch 
luminosity bump, resulting in a significant decrease in the median value
 of the period spacing. Clearly, at a given value of $\log g$, red giant 
models with different overshoot values have significantly different 
oscillation properties especially around the red giant branch luminosity
 bump.

            In this work, we consider that the dipole gravity modes follow the asymptotic comb-like pattern given by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...618A.109M/abstract" target="_blank"> Mosser et. al. 2018</a>. This way, since <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3406T/abstract" target="_blank"> GYRE</a>  gives the g-mode radial order, n<sub>g</sub>, we can find the $\epsilon_g$
 (gravity offset) values for the different overshoot red giant models at
 different evolutionary states along the red giant branch. Plotting the 
evolution of $\epsilon_g$ gives the figure on the right where we can see that the values of $\epsilon_g$
 for different overshoot red giant models start at about the same point 
at $\log g = 2.7$, before any of the models have gone throught the red 
giant branch luminoisty bump. As the red giant models approach the 
luminosity bump, $\epsilon_g$ decreases steadily then spikes up before 
returning to a steady state. The highest overshoot model goes through 
the bump first and the model with no overshoot goes through the bump 
last and we can see the $\epsilon_g$ value for the higher overshoot 
models fall first, then returns to a steady state first. Note that in 
actual observations, when the radial order of the g-mode is not known, 
the gravity offset parameter is only known to mod 1 but this $\epsilon_g$ behavior of falling near the luminosity bump then returning to a steady value could still be detected.

Due to this internal structure dependence, the oscillation properties of
 the red giant also change which is apparent after calculating the 
oscillation modes of the stellar model using <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3406T/abstract" target="_blank"> GYRE</a>. Using the oscillation mode data, we show period spacing diagrams, period echelle diagrams, and an $\epsilon_g$
 evolution plot which show that at a given value of $\log g$, red giant 
models evolved with different amounts of step envelope overshoot show 
different asteroseismic observables. These differences are related to 
the evolutionary state of the model before, during, or after the red 
giant luminosity bump and viewing where the red giant branch luminoisty 
bump is located (through $\epsilon_g$ observations or through searching
 for H-R diagram overdensities in red giant catalouges) can tell us 
about how much envelope overshooting should be incorporated in red giant
 models.
